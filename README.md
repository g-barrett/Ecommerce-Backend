# Ecommerce Backend

## Description
A backend databse that utilizes express, sequelize, and MySQL to interact with our stored data to view, update, create, and delete items or values from different models.

## Motivation
I wanted to get more practice with ORM as well as express. I wanted to prove that I can take the coding practices I've learned thus far to apply  to a practical environment that I could very possibly be using in real job settings.

## Installation
You'll want to clone/fork the repo, and open in your preferred IDE. Run `mysql -u root -p` and enter your password. Enter `source db/schema.sql` then `USE ecommerce_db` then `quit`. Run `npm i` and `node seeds/index.js`. Everything should be ready to go.

## Usage
Run `node server.js` to get your server running and open Insomnia. You might want to open a new project. From there you can set up GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using the routes from within the code. Have fun adding, editing, and deleting all kinds of items from the database!
